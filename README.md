# vite-react-ts-template

This repository contains a very minimal template for quickly setting up a
React + TypeScript project that's built with Vite and optionally deployed
to GitHub Pages.

## Usage

### Starting a new project

The easiest way to use this repository is to [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) it:

```
npx degit akx/vite-react-ts-template my-project
```

You can also of course clone the repo yourself, remove the `.git` directory
and any extraneous files (such as this one, `degit.json` and the WTFPL `LICENSE` file)
yourself.

### And then what?

After you've set up your project:

* Use the `dev` script for the Vite live server.
* Use `build` to type-check and build the project.
* Use `lint` to run ESlint.
* Use `prettify` to have Prettier reformat your files.
